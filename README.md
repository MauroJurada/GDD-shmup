### GDD SHMUP

```markdown
Classic little simple 2D side scrolling Shmup (“Shoot’em up”) game made with Unity. 

# The basic features it contains:
   - Player Character moving from left to right through the level in a side scrolling manner
   - Ability for the player to move freely within the bounds of the level (Arrow Keys or WASD)
   - Ability for the player to fire projectiles
   - Enemies entering the screen from the right hand side
   - Lose condition: enemies can destroy the player character (either with projectiles or by collision)
   - Win condition: highscore based system where the player plays endlessly until he/she reaches the lose condition 
   - Start menu screen at the beginning 
   
# Exploding projectile: 
- Creates a special type of projectile which explodes if it hits an enemy and then does area damage, which means it hurts every enemy within a certain radius from the impact point. Visuals clearly communicate to the player where damage is applied.

# Ship selection: 
- Simple player character selection screen with 2 choices before starting the game. The 2 chooseable player characters are different in regards to visuals as well as moving speed and projectile damage.

# parallax effect for the background
